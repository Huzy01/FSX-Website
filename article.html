      <h1>Newly Launched Features</h1>
      <p> <h3 align="left"> New Storefront </h3>
<p>Our first iteration of the new storefront experience is live! You can see what games are trending, filter by genre, and more - find games you love faster and easier than before. Please try it out and let us know what you think.</p>

 <h3 align="left"> Checkout Overlay </h3>
<p>We launched our checkout overlay with our partners at YAGER in their competitive quest shooter “The Cycle”. The new checkout overlay allows games to use our payment platform from within the game.</p>
<br>

<p><i><b>We will keep you posted as we develop new features for our game overlay tech.</b></p></i>
<br>
<h3 align="left">Storefront Optimization</h3>
<p>Our free game releases have driven a lot of traffic to our site and in the past it has not always handled that well. We have made those high traffic times smoother by improving our infrastructure and site call patterns.</p>
<li>By implementing local caching, we reduced queries to remote data stores and almost eliminated time spent accessing remote databases. </li>
<br>
<li>Hot local caches also mean that an increase in traffic results in better performance. For example, during a 350% traffic increase leading up to the Fortnite Chapter 2 event, our service response time decreased by 30%.</li>
<br>
<h3 align="left">3D Secure for Europe</h3>
<p>3D Secure is important for new European regulatory requirements for Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). Support for 3D Secure has begun to roll out and will be slowly rolling out across multiple countries over the next few months.  Players may be asked for additional authentication when making a credit card purchase in Europe.</p>
<br>
<h3 align="left">Thai Language Support</h3>
<p>You can now choose Thai from the supported language options on the website or within the launcher. If your operating system is already Thai and you’ve not explicitly chosen a different language other than English, the launcher should automatically switch to showing the new translations.</p>
